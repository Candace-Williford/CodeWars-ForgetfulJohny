# CodeWars-ForgetfulJohny

Johny has to create many mailboxes. He knows all of the email addresses, but forgot all the passwords; But Johny 
remembers that he hides his passwords within the email address and can be revealed using the following steps:

1)all symbols after @ must be removed

2)register of all leters must be changed(uppercase goes to lower and vise versa)

3)all digits must be moved to the front of the password

Your work is to help Johny recover all his passwords!

Example ----> Pass("1johny2@mail.ru")=="12JOHNY"

Note: if mail is empty return null
